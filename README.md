# The JavaScript Oxidation Compiler (oxc)

## Why this project?

The goal of this project is to:

* Create a blazingly fast JavaScript Compiler written in Rust.
* Provide good documentation on learning Rust and compiler techniques.

And mostly importantly, an invitation for you to come and learn Rust with me.
We will learn a lot from each other!

You can watch this project and also [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/boshen_c) if you don't have the time to
Rust but would like to learn things.

## Call for action

We now have a fully working parser as a baseline, it is not polished yet,
so it would be much appreciated if I can invite you and review any of the code and point out for improvements.
I welcome all nitpickings and bikesheddings.

## Milestone

The current objective is to write a JavaScript parser which can parse most of the language conformance tests from
Test262, Babel and TypeScript.
