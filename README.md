# The JavaScript Oxidation Compiler (oxc)

## Why this project?

The aim of this project is to:

* Create a modestly JavaScript Compiler written in Rust.
* Provide good documentation on learning Rust and compiler techniques.

And mostly importantly, an invitation for you to come and learn Rust with me.
We will learn a lot from each other!

You can watch this project and also [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/boshen_c) if you don't have the time to
Rust but would like to learn things.

## Milestone

The current goal is to write a JavaScript parser which can parse most of the language conformance tests from
Test262, Babel and TypeScript.

## Learning Resources

* My [small tutorial on how to write a JavaScript Parser in Rust](https://boshen.github.io/javascript-parser-in-rust/)
